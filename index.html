        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! My name is Tiina Lakkapää and I am an enthusiastic aspiring software engineer, currently completing my degree in Software Engineering. 
            As I near the completion of my studies, I am eager to transition into the professional world and contribute to innovative projects. 
            My passion lies in coding and exploring new technologies to build efficient, scalable, and user-friendly applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout my studies, I have gained hands-on experience with several programming languages and technologies, 
            including <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong>, and <strong>React</strong>. 
            Among these, I have the strongest proficiency in <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>, particularly with Python's applications in data science 
            and machine learning. I have hands-on experience with tools such as <strong>NumPy</strong> and <strong>TensorFlow</strong> through academic projects, 
            where I applied them to solve problems in machine learning and data analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am always eager to learn and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends. My goal is to contribute to impactful software development projects, 
            combining my technical skills with a passion for innovation and problem-solving. I look forward to applying my knowledge to help create solutions that 
            make a real difference.
        </p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/TLakkap/TrainingDiary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mobile App: Training Diary (React Native & TypeScript)</a></h3>
            <p>
                This mobile app is developed using React Native. The idea for the app came from my own passion for fitness, 
                especially strength training. I wanted to create a tool that would help users easily log and track their workouts, 
                including details such as exercise type, duration, and progression over time. All workout data is stored securely on the device, 
                ensuring privacy and easy access. The app is designed with a user-friendly interface to provide an intuitive experience, 
                helping users stay motivated, track their progress, and stay organized in their fitness journey.

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/TLakkap/LearnTineLearn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Web App (Java, Spring, PostgreSQL, React, JavaScript)</a></h3>
            <p>
                This web application is developed using Java, Spring, PostgreSQL, React, and JavaScript. 
                The app enables users to browse various topics, each containing detailed notes and information on specific subjects. 
                Users can easily select a topic and read through study material or notes associated with it.

                The application features an admin-only login system, where only authorized users can log in to add new courses, topics, 
                and relevant content. This ensures that the platform remains organized and up-to-date with accurate and relevant information.

                The idea for this project came from my own need to store and organize study notes under different categories. 
                I wanted a simple yet effective way to access and review my notes at a later time, making studying more efficient.
