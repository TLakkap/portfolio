        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I am an enthusiastic software developer who loves coding and exploring new technologies. 
            I have a passion for creating visually appealing and user-friendly applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am always eager to learn new things, and I enjoy solving challenging problems through code. 
            My areas of expertise include <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, 
            <strong>TypeScript</strong>, and <strong>React</strong>. I am particularly interested in Artificial Intelligence 
            and how it can be integrated into modern applications.

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/TLakkap/TrainingDiary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mobile App (React Native & TypeScript)</a></h3>
            <p>
                This mobile app is developed using React Native. The idea for the app came from my own passion for fitness, 
                especially strength training. I wanted to create a tool that would help users easily log and track their workouts, 
                including details such as exercise type, duration, and progression over time. All workout data is stored securely on the device, 
                ensuring privacy and easy access. The app is designed with a user-friendly interface to provide an intuitive experience, 
                helping users stay motivated, track their progress, and stay organized in their fitness journey.

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/TLakkap/LearnTineLearn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Web App (Java, Spring, PostgreSQL, React, JavaScript)</a></h3>
            <p>
                This web application is developed using Java, Spring, PostgreSQL, React, and JavaScript. 
                The app enables users to browse various topics, each containing detailed notes and information on specific subjects. 
                Users can easily select a topic and read through study material or notes associated with it.

                The application features an admin-only login system, where only authorized users can log in to add new courses, topics, 
                and relevant content. This ensures that the platform remains organized and up-to-date with accurate and relevant information.

                The idea for this project came from my own need to store and organize study notes under different categories. 
                I wanted a simple yet effective way to access and review my notes at a later time, making studying more efficient.
